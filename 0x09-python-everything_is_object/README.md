0x09 Python - Everything is object üêç

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers a technical part of OOP by solving multiple questions



At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:



What is an object

What is the difference between a class and an object or instance

What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object

What is a reference

What is an assignment

What is an alias

How to know if two variables are identical

How to know if two variables are linked to the same object

How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the * * CPython implementation)

What is mutable and immutable

What are the built-in mutable types

What are the built-in immutable types

How does Python pass variables to functions
